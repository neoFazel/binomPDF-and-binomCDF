# Binomial PDF and CDF Functions

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the implementation and usage of the Binomial Probability Distribution Function (PDF) and Binomial Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) in Python. The notebook includes Python functions for both binomPDF and binomCDF, along with a relevant example to illustrate their practical applications.

## Contents

- **Python Functions**: Implementation of binomPDF and binomCDF to calculate binomial probabilities.
- **Example Usage**: A real-world example demonstrating the use of these functions in a data science context.

## Functions

### Binomial PDF (binomPDF)
Calculates the probability of obtaining exactly \( k \) successes in \( n \) trials with a probability \( p \) of success on each trial.

### Binomial CDF (binomCDF)
Calculates the cumulative probability of obtaining at most \( k \) successes in \( n \) trials with a probability \( p \) of success on each trial.

## Example

The notebook includes an example related to quality control in manufacturing, where the functions are used to calculate the probability of finding defective items in a sample.

For detailed explanations and code please refer to the Jupyter notebook in this repository.
